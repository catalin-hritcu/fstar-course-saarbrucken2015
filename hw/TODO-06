TODO:
- simple state
  - extend strong reduction STLC or LambdaOmega or both?
  - probably easy
- subtyping relation (not function!)
  - extend strong reduction STLC or LambdaOmega? 
  - should make sure that it's not too hard! Start with STLC!

MAYBE
- let rec again?
  - probably easy
  - too boring? extend LambdaOmega?
- dynamically allocated references? (TAPL 13)
  - as an extension from simple state
  - not needed for TinyF* though

NO
- integers: way too boring, we can give it to them for subtyping
- pairs: boring and useless for tiny F*
