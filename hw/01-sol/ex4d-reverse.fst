(* Perhaps you did it like this: *)

                 -> Lemma (snoc l1 h1 = snoc l2 h2 ==> l1 = l2 && h1 = h2)

  | hd1::tl1, hd2::tl2 ->
    rev_injective_1 tl1 tl2;
    snoc_injective (reverse tl1) hd1 (reverse tl2) hd2
  | _ -> ()

(* That's quite a tedious proof, isn't it. Here's a simpler proof. *)

val rev_injective_2: l1:list 'a -> l2:list 'a 
                 -> Lemma (reverse l1 = reverse l2 ==> l1 = l2)
let rev_injective_2 l1 l2 = rev_involutive l1; rev_involutive l2
(*
reverse l1 = reverse l2
l1 = reverse (reverse l1)
l2 = reverse (reverse l2)
*)

(* The `rev_injective_2` proof is based on the idea that every involutive
function is injective. We've already proven that `reverse` is
involutive. So, we invoke our lemma, once for `l1` and once for `l2`.
This gives to the SMT solver the information that `reverse (reverse
l1) = l1` and `reverse (reverse l2) = l2`, which suffices to complete
the proof. As usual, when structuring proofs, lemmas are your friends! *)
