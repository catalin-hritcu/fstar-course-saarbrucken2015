Afterthoughts
- the subtyping exercise seems unnecessarily tricky in this style,
  so it was a good idea to make it optional
- for subyping and if-then-else we could compute the join of two types,
  instead of adding an useless annotation (because of function types
  we would also need a mutually recursive meet)
